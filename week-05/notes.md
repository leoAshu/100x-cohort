# React Deep Dive

## State

-   is an object of the dynamic contents on a website
-   state is dynamic and changes from time to time
-   the UI responds and updates according to the state

## Components

-   is the UI part that represents the state
-   is a reusable dynamic HTML component

## Re-rendering

-   is the process of updating the UI to reflect the state change
-   a state change triggers a re-render
-   a re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes
