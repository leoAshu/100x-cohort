# Week 7

## Single Page Applications

-   React creates single page applications
-   where, client-side routing is done
    -   all the routes are present in the single bundle
    -   server is not hit more than once for routing

## Lazy Loading

-   provides only the bundle required to render the route
-   bundles for other routes will not be included
-   optimizes the web app

## Prop Drilling

## Context API

-   helps avoid prop drilling
