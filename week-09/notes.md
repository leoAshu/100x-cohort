# Week 9

## TypeScript

-   a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft
-   is a strict **syntactical superset** of JavaScript and adds optional statci typing to the language
-   gets transpiled down to javascript by the typescript compiler `tsc`
    -   other typescript compilers include `esbuild` and `swc`
-   while transpilation, the typescript compiler performs **type checking** and converts the code into javascript only if no errors (including type errors) are found
